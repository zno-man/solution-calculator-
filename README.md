# solution-calculator-


GOAL
-----
The goal of this project is to make a program is to make it easier to solve similar numerical questions ( numerical questions having the same statement and formula but different values ) ,such questions should be easily be solved by feeding the data only once.

HOW TO USE 
--------
pre-feed the solution to a particular problem in text file ; along with equations  and  required constants  and it will solve a similar questions for you.
<br>

'  q: ' tag is used to indicate a label of the question ; it is not relevant to the solution ; its use is only to store the question statement  <br>
'  v: ' tag is used to give all the constants to the program ; it can be edited later during execution                                           <br> 
'  e: ' tag is used to give all the equations ; the statement on the right side of the ' = ' sign is evaluated and the variables that are needed should be given under v: tag or should be evaluated befor the current equation is evaluated. ie feed the equations in the proper sequence of occurence ( in the solution ) rather the dependent values should come only after the independent values in the equation are evaluated.

DEMO
-----
a demo file (questions.txt) is included in this repository please refer to it for further clarification.

NOTE
-----

please note that  - the text file should have the same name as the one in this repository.
                  - for proper execution the tags should occur in the same sequence as in the demo file ( q: then v: then e: )
